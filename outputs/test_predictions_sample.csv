A movie can\'t do everything that a book does, and we all know that.  We also know that a movie *trailer* can\'t do everything that a movie does - and in fact, doesn\'t even try.  A movie trailer is about getting general audiences to buy tickets, not about convincing serious audiences familiar with the source material to attend.  But this is worth seeing.\nFirst, let me tell you all the ways that I was wrong when this project was first brought to public attention:  \n* Thought the updating from the \'50s to the \'80s from the Stephen King source material was an indication that the movie was corrupt.\nIt was a reasonable belief, but it was wrong.  The ""It"" movie is not corrupt - it\'s sincere.  Still wish it was in the \'50s to better reflect the source material, but **it totally works**, for real.  \n* Thought tt0254674 did not look frightening.\nIn the trailer, he doesn\'t.  But that\'s because trailers are bullshit at communicating horror.  This movie is some scary shit.\n* The script is really fucking awesome.\nI know Stephen King books, and this script did justice.  It was not the same as the book, but it brought it out - at least to the extent that a movie *can* do justice to a book.\nA book is a fundamentally deeper creature than a movie, and there\'s no avoiding that.  The movie isn\'t really able to show you an entire town the way the book is.  But it\'s a great horror movie, no doubt, and creates a world for subsequent exploration.\nIt\'s scary, many of the characters feel realistic, and you feel immersed in their world.\nI was wrong to be so contemptuous of the adaptation when it was first announced and the trailers introduced.\nI endorse it now, as a Stephen King fan and a fan of film in general.\n']",1.0,1.0

It\'s refreshing to watch a something that isn\'t afraid to tt22476178its time setting everything up. I loved how long it took for us to meet the villain. Then his intro was spectacular. I immediately knew what type of villain Hans was going to be. What a smooth entrance. Although I will say, Hans never really seemed German.  The other villains had very distinctly german inflections when they spoke, while Hans used a more general European accent. Nothing major, just if 11/13 members of your group speak with an inflection then you should as well. I assume part of thtt22476178ice was to distinguish Hans even further from the rest of his group.\nI loved tt22476178. He was cool and badass like tt0936501, while also feeling jagged and unrefined. It was clear that he was out of his element from the getgo, which made watching him feel so gosh darn compelling. His resourcefulness was great! I loved that he never felt special when it came to his physical or mental ability- he frankly just did what was necessary to survive. Shooting the fleeing cop car was an interesting and unexpected moment which set my expectations for the remainder of the film. tt0095016 isn\'t noteworthy in any category other than his tenacity. \nThe first physical meeting between Hans and John was definitely a highlight. Watching the two of them feel each other out was incredible. The moment where Hans confirms it\'s indeed tt0095016 was phenomenal. Rickman made an absolutely perfect face for the occasion.\nOverall, it was a fantastic film.\n**8/10**\n**tt0095016 Trilogy**\nI watched all three of these films back to back, so I currently view them as an inseperable unit. They were enjoyable but their in-universe logic was frustratingly inconsistent. Throughout all three films, Doc is initially hesitant to change the past as any alteration could potentially destroy the future. He then proceeds to condone alterations so long as they improve the lives of either himself or tt0095016\'s family. When an external person, a la Biff Tannen, attempted to do essentially the same thing Doc became very preachy about time travel safety. I understand Biff is selfish and antagonistic, but still the hypocrasy was degraded his character to me. \n It was frustrating that every tt0936501 man seemed to act exactly like George tt0054215 from prior to John McClane\'s interference. Realistically, I\'m sure that not every member of the John McClane lineage could be that cartoonishly submissive. The third film\'s character, Sheamus John McClane, certainly felt more pacifistic than submissive. Where did that trait spawn then? How did tt2911666 Jr become submissive when his father was clearly aggressive. \nMost of the trilogy felt like this many scenes created more questions than they did coherency.\nJohn McClane\'s ""story arc"" was John McClaneg for me as well. I\'d prefer if it centered around a more interesting topic than John McClane getting aggressive whenever his masculinity was called into question. \nThat\'s all for today! Hopefully, later entries will be a bit better written. I\'m using this as practice as I recover. John McClane. It was possibly a bad idea to write this immediately after getting surgery.\n']",1.0,1.0

Val Kilmer as “tt5493970” becomes the perfect counter part to Harry and is my favourite Role of his, the scenes those two do together have me in stitches, a scene involving a Russian roulette style of interrogation has to be my favourite. The film also stars the amazing Michelle Monaghan who is also excellent in the movie. This movie can be immersing, hilarious, interesting and at times dark.

It is one of the most intense and suspenseful movies I have ever seen. Like literally, there is a scene where a phone rings, and it\'s the most intense scene ever.\nIt\'s so layered and complex that it even is hard to follow sometimes, who can play the cat/mouse (or should I say rat) game better? And then when it settles and moves at its own speed to follow the unconventional narrative and storytelling, it escalates into a few quick kills in the end. See, it doesn\'t grab someone emotionally and that\'s quite unique. The escalation is logical consequence from the sense of urgency created over the whole movie. It\'s brilliant captured in the final shot.\nOther than that, typical Scorsese - cast delivers (abso-fuckin-loutely), great soundtrack, great imagery and over all really memorable dialogue.\nWhat do you think about tt0407887?']",1.0,1.0

I’m a musician and we get regular gigs opening for big name bands but I watch a movie like this and it makes me want to do more with my life. I want to act, I want to write graphic novels and science fiction books, I want to paint and make a living doing so. With that said, what are some movies that really, really inspired you to just wake up and get a move on with your life? I understand that many will say, “You just have to do it.” Watching films about bands as a kid made me want to start a band, so I did. I’m curious if there are any movies out there that will just simply inspire me to be a better version of myself? Sorry for the life story, I felt it was valid in order to convey exactly what type of “inspiring film” I’m looking for. Thanks!\nEdit: With these films having inspired you, I’d love to hear exactly what it is you went on achieved or tried? I find it so intriguing to see people truly have their dreams come true!

A good idea for this type of thing, though different section, would be from the television show called tt8193366, where we follow the story through the eyes of Walter White and slowly see him turn from being the hero of his story to becoming the villain of his story. So while there will still probably need to be a hero (Or not, depending on the type of story), one thing that would separate the hero from the main protagonist is that we are following the story primarily through the eyes of the villain, rather than the hero, although we would often get glimpses of what the hero is up to, leading up to the final battle of the hero and the villain so we see that the villain would get stopped.

Val Kilmer as “tt5493970” becomes the perfect counter part to Harry and is my favourite Role of his, the scenes those two do together have me in stitches, a scene involving a Russian roulette style of interrogation has to be my favourite.

A movie trailer is about getting general audiences to buy tickets, not about convincing serious audiences familiar with the source material to attend.  But this is worth seeing.\nFirst, let me tell you all the ways that I was wrong when this project was first brought to public attention:  \n* Thought the updating from the \'50s to the \'80s from the Stephen King source material was an indication that the movie was corrupt.\nIt was a reasonable belief, but it was wrong.  The ""It"" movie is not corrupt - it\'s sincere.

But that\'s because trailers are bullshit at communicating horror.  This movie is some scary shit.\n* The script is really fucking awesome.\nI know Stephen King books, and this script did justice.  It was not the same as the book, but it brought it out - at least to the extent that a movie *can* do justice to a book.\nA book is a fundamentally deeper creature than a movie, and there\'s no avoiding that.  The movie isn\'t really able to show you an entire town the way the book is.  But it\'s a great horror movie, no doubt, and creates a world for subsequent exploration.\nIt\'s scary, many of the characters feel realistic, and you feel immersed in their world.\nI was wrong to be so contemptuous of the adaptation when it was first announced and the trailers introduced.\nI endorse it now, as a Stephen King fan and a fan of film in general.\n']",1.0,1.0

The Amazon page does not specify if this was the X-rated version though, so I checked it myself out of curiosity. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FY84E9G/ref=atv_feed_catalog&amp;tag=iw_tt0387514_movie-20&amp;ref_=asc_homepage""]",1.0,1.0

Maybe you don\'t know the finer details but you know where its *generally* going.  The characters have to be introduced, the main characters motivation needs to be established, the conflict introduced, the downfall, the rise back up, the resolution and we\'re walking off in the sunset by the end two, maybe two and a half hours.  Shit, if you\'ve seen enough movies you may have even developed a terrible habit of being able to tell how far into the movie you are, how much time is left and come up with reasons for why certain things need to happen for them to rap it up in the next half hour or so, which is a habit that can suck if you\'re trying to get lost in a movie or you want to relive the mysticism of storytelling films had for you when you were younger.  tt1931533 doesn\'t *fix* this issue but it is so on-the-nose about story beats that rolling through them *is* the fun part.  The characters are literally, unconciously talking about them and you\'re living in it through their dialogue.  [For anyone on the fence, this is the opening scene to tt1931533.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS5AUUKztcY)\nAnd tt1931533 is just a fantastic story with an entire cast of well thought-out characters that never don\'t make sense.  Every character has a believable motivation, their actions make sense and they feel *real* even if you don\'t know anyone that\'s quite like them.  Its just a damn good story and its probably my favorite movie of his.  Showing all the differing perspectives and how easily we can paint people wrong and how unfair we can be to each other.  The dialogue and actions between the characters is just mesmerizing and each scene is a treat just because the previous scene had them doing things you hadn\'t really considered an option and seeing what happens next is genuinely a mystery.  There\'s so much heartbreak for every character yet there\'s no unbelievable melodrama.  I don\'t think there is *ever* a moment in that movie where one can roll their eyes and say ""that\'s trite"".  Even if a character is being ridiculous, its reasonably explained and it feels like McDonagh knows that you know the person is ridiculous.']",0.0,0.0

But I just watched Scorsese\'s ""tt0407887"" for the first time and have to share my experience.\nFirst of all let me say that Scorsese is one of my favorite directors (and I still don\'t know why I never watched tt0407887) and tt0407887 is arguably my favorite movie of all time.\nWhile tt0407887 has many similarities with tt0407887 - the voice over, the ensemble cast of important characters, the mafia/mob thematic, and basic themes of greed and betrayal - it quickly evolves into something new. It is one of the most intense and suspenseful movies I have ever seen. Like literally, there is a scene where a phone rings, and it\'s the most intense scene ever.\nIt\'s so layered and complex that it even is hard to follow sometimes, who can play the cat/mouse (or should I say rat) game better? And then when it settles and moves at its own speed to follow the unconventional narrative and storytelling, it escalates into a few quick kills in the end. See, it doesn\'t grab someone emotionally and that\'s quite unique. The escalation is logical consequence from the sense of urgency created over the whole movie. It\'s brilliant captured in the final shot.\nOther than that, typical Scorsese - cast delivers (abso-fuckin-loutely), great soundtrack, great imagery and over all really memorable dialogue.\nWhat do you think about tt0407887?']",1.0,1.0

It\'s strange to fit tt0365748 (Edgar Wright, 2004) in a genre. Of course it\'s funny, so it\'s a comedy. But it also has lots of zombies and tension, so it\'s a horror movie. But it actually has some really engaging character interactions and character moments, so it\'s a drama.\nIt\'s all of it and it\'s fucking brilliant!\nEdgar Wright manages to mix the trivial and conventional with something so absurd and ridiculous and the result is nothing short of incredible.\nThe story is fairly conventional british drama in the first act, then it introduces the zombies and how our characters react to them and then it\'s a completely survival/massacre in the end.\nThe script is close to perfect.

It\'s refreshing to watch a something that isn\'t afraid to tt22476178its time setting everything up. I loved how long it took for us to meet the villain. Then his intro was spectacular. I immediately knew what type of villain Hans was going to be. What a smooth entrance. Although I will say, Hans never really seemed German.  The other villains had very distinctly german inflections when they spoke, while Hans used a more general European accent. Nothing major, just if 11/13 members of your group speak with an inflection then you should as well. I assume part of thtt22476178ice was to distinguish Hans even further from the rest of his group.\nI loved tt22476178. He was cool and badass like tt0936501, while also feeling jagged and unrefined. It was clear that he was out of his element from the getgo, which made watching him feel so gosh darn compelling. His resourcefulness was great! I loved that he never felt special when it came to his physical or mental ability- he frankly just did what was necessary to survive. Shooting the fleeing cop car was an interesting and unexpected moment which set my expectations for the remainder of the film. tt0095016 isn\'t noteworthy in any category other than his tenacity. \nThe first physical meeting between Hans and John was definitely a highlight. Watching the two of them feel each other out was incredible. The moment where Hans confirms it\'s indeed tt0095016 was phenomenal. Rickman made an absolutely perfect face for the occasion.\nOverall, it was a fantastic film.\n**8/10**\n**tt0095016 Trilogy**\nI watched all three of these films back to back, so I currently view them as an inseperable unit. They were enjoyable but their in-universe logic was frustratingly inconsistent. Throughout all three films, Doc is initially hesitant to change the past as any alteration could potentially destroy the future. He then proceeds to condone alterations so long as they improve the lives of either himself or tt0095016\'s family. When an external person, a la Biff Tannen, attempted to do essentially the same thing Doc became very preachy about time travel safety. I understand Biff is selfish and antagonistic, but still the hypocrasy was degraded his character to me. \n It was frustrating that every tt0936501 man seemed to act exactly like George tt0054215 from prior to John McClane\'s interference. Realistically, I\'m sure that not every member of the John McClane lineage could be that cartoonishly submissive. The third film\'s character, Sheamus John McClane, certainly felt more pacifistic than submissive. Where did that trait spawn then? How did tt2911666 Jr become submissive when his father was clearly aggressive. \nMost of the trilogy felt like this many scenes created more questions than they did coherency.\nJohn McClane\'s ""story arc"" was John McClaneg for me as well. I\'d prefer if it centered around a more interesting topic than John McClane getting aggressive whenever his masculinity was called into question. \nThat\'s all for today! Hopefully, later entries will be a bit better written. I\'m using this as practice as I recover. John McClane. It was possibly a bad idea to write this immediately after getting surgery.\n']",1.0,1.0

It tried to be grittily realistic in its stab at “dark” humor, but there was no real world consistency to any of the movie’s logic and there were no real world consequences to any actions, rendering the stakes so low that it was impossible to care for anyone or anything. It was a bad movie through and through but here are a couple specific gripes:\n-the movie opens with McDormand driving along a country road and “discovers” the tt0424846. Turns out they were in view of her house the whole time?\n-Mcdormand BLOWS UP A POLICE STATION and gets away with it clean thanks to one word of mouth alibi, even though she would clearly be number one suspect in the case seeing as she put up 3 BILLBOARDS attacking the police station. AND WAS SEEN OUTSIDE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD.\n-Sam Rockwell can’t tell he’s in a fire because he has headphones on??\n-The man who threatens McDormand in her store is revealed to be a bad man from out of state... so why the hell would he care enough to go harass a woman embroiled in a very local scandal?? Just passing through? gonna go harass a local? Why would he give a shit?\n-“I HOPE YOU GET RAPED” was about the biggest eye roller line of all time\n-the only black woman gets jailed for weed because of McDormand and we are given no hint that McDormand even visited her or gave it a thought. Next time we see her is conveniently when she’s let out to date the only black guy (besides the shoehorned in police chief).\n-No character arcs were earned. Woody Harrelson’s suicide being the catalyst for everyone’s change was one of the laziest and most hackneyed plot devices in recent memory.\n-the ex-husbands girlfriend was  a cartoony, stupid stab at humor inconsistent with the tone the movie was attempting. Are these people real or cartoons? There was no consistency to any stylization.\n-the ending of the movie implying these two enemies (friends now thanks to an unearned reconciliation) may go kill a different random rapist was fucking retarded.\nI had more gripes but I haven’t seen it since theaters and I won’t see it again to remember them.']",0.0,0.0

It is one of the most intense and suspenseful movies I have ever seen. Like literally, there is a scene where a phone rings, and it\'s the most intense scene ever.\nIt\'s so layered and complex that it even is hard to follow sometimes, who can play the cat/mouse (or should I say rat) game better? And then when it settles and moves at its own speed to follow the unconventional narrative and storytelling, it escalates into a few quick kills in the end. See, it doesn\'t grab someone emotionally and that\'s quite unique. The escalation is logical consequence from the sense of urgency created over the whole movie. It\'s brilliant captured in the final shot.\nOther than that, typical Scorsese - cast delivers (abso-fuckin-loutely), great soundtrack, great imagery and over all really memorable dialogue.\nWhat do you think about tt0407887?']",1.0,1.0

It\'s strange to fit tt0365748 (Edgar Wright, 2004) in a genre. Of course it\'s funny, so it\'s a comedy. But it also has lots of zombies and tension, so it\'s a horror movie. But it actually has some really engaging character interactions and character moments, so it\'s a drama.\nIt\'s all of it and it\'s fucking brilliant!\nEdgar Wright manages to mix the trivial and conventional with something so absurd and ridiculous and the result is nothing short of incredible.\nThe story is fairly conventional british drama in the first act, then it introduces the zombies and how our characters react to them and then it\'s a completely survival/massacre in the end.\nThe script is close to perfect. Every element or plot point or theme introduced in the beginning, somehow affects the later circumstances. Be it a catchphrase, a character relation, a place or even a video game instruction.\nThe performances are top notch, the humor works brilliantly, but even the characters feel so ""real"" and relatable.I could go on and on and talk about the one liners and all the ingenious moments but I\'m just gonna stop and ask you, what do you think about tt0365748?\n']",1.0,1.0

It\'s refreshing to watch a something that isn\'t afraid to tt22476178its time setting everything up. I loved how long it took for us to meet the villain. Then his intro was spectacular. I immediately knew what type of villain Hans was going to be. What a smooth entrance. Although I will say, Hans never really seemed German.  The other villains had very distinctly german inflections when they spoke, while Hans used a more general European accent. Nothing major, just if 11/13 members of your group speak with an inflection then you should as well. I assume part of thtt22476178ice was to distinguish Hans even further from the rest of his group.\nI loved tt22476178. He was cool and badass like tt0936501, while also feeling jagged and unrefined. It was clear that he was out of his element from the getgo, which made watching him feel so gosh darn compelling. His resourcefulness was great! I loved that he never felt special when it came to his physical or mental ability- he frankly just did what was necessary to survive. Shooting the fleeing cop car was an interesting and unexpected moment which set my expectations for the remainder of the film. tt0095016 isn\'t noteworthy in any category other than his tenacity. \nThe first physical meeting between Hans and John was definitely a highlight. Watching the two of them feel each other out was incredible. The moment where Hans confirms it\'s indeed tt0095016 was phenomenal. Rickman made an absolutely perfect face for the occasion.\nOverall, it was a fantastic film.\n**8/10**\n**tt0095016 Trilogy**\nI watched all three of these films back to back, so I currently view them as an inseperable unit. They were enjoyable but their in-universe logic was frustratingly inconsistent. Throughout all three films, Doc is initially hesitant to change the past as any alteration could potentially destroy the future. He then proceeds to condone alterations so long as they improve the lives of either himself or tt0095016\'s family. When an external person, a la Biff Tannen, attempted to do essentially the same thing Doc became very preachy about time travel safety. I understand Biff is selfish and antagonistic, but still the hypocrasy was degraded his character to me. \n It was frustrating that every tt0936501 man seemed to act exactly like George tt0054215 from prior to John McClane\'s interference. Realistically, I\'m sure that not every member of the John McClane lineage could be that cartoonishly submissive. The third film\'s character, Sheamus John McClane, certainly felt more pacifistic than submissive. Where did that trait spawn then? How did tt2911666 Jr become submissive when his father was clearly aggressive. \nMost of the trilogy felt like this many scenes created more questions than they did coherency.\nJohn McClane\'s ""story arc"" was John McClaneg for me as well. I\'d prefer if it centered around a more interesting topic than John McClane getting aggressive whenever his masculinity was called into question. \nThat\'s all for today! Hopefully, later entries will be a bit better written. I\'m using this as practice as I recover. John McClane. It was possibly a bad idea to write this immediately after getting surgery.\n']",1.0,1.0

I absolutely fell in love and am now upset that I slept on it for so long. This film is a huge inspiration to so many of my favorites and I never even realized it. Martin Sheen is just incredible here. He has to be one of the most charming and trigger-happy characters that I’ve ever seen on screen and I loved every second of it. This was only my first time watching the film but I wouldn’t be surprised if it goes down as my favorite performance of his. Sissy Spacek is also fantastic and works with Sheen to make their relationship so fascinating to watch. I could see some of my favorite films in tt0069762 as I watched it. I couldn’t help but notice threads of Godard’s 1960 classic tt0069762 in the plot and the way these two characters act together. I instantly recognized the beautiful theme from knowing Hans Zimmer’s adaptation of it in Tony Scott’s 1995 film tt0069762, which I now realize is basically just these two characters in a Tarantino movie. The unconventional romance Kip and Holly share is beautiful and the cinematography maintains this loveliness throughout, even through all the bloodshed.

Can you recommend me a few good movies about where the main protagonist, who we see the story through their eyes, is also the villain of the movie? As someone who is trying to get inspired for writing a story exploring this concept, I'd like to dive deeper into this. A good idea for this type of thing, though different section, would be from the television show called tt8193366, where we follow the story through the eyes of Walter White and slowly see him turn from being the hero of his story to becoming the villain of his story. So while there will still probably need to be a hero (Or not, depending on the type of story), one thing that would separate the hero from the main protagonist is that we are following the story primarily through the eyes of the villain, rather than the hero, although we would often get glimpses of what the hero is up to, leading up to the final battle of the hero and the villain so we see that the villain would get stopped.

One of my favorite Christmas movies AND animated movies of all time is the 2010 Japanese film *tt1572781*, a continuation/conclusion to the anime *The Melancholy of tt1572781*, which in turn it\'s based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa. However, as much as I would like to do a straightforward recommendation I can\'t because the movie is impenetrable without the context of the TV series, which might seems like a detriment but considering even people who don\'t like the series actually love the movie, it\'s at least worth a shot.\n*tt1572781*, the anime, focuses on the title character, a smart/cute/athletic high school girl who doesn\'t like normal reality and would rather spend her time in crazy supernatural adventures with aliens, time travelers and espers (people with inhuman abilities). The other lead character is Kyon, a cynical and not-so-bright high schooler who somehow befriends Haruhi and eventually convince her to create her own club in order to cure her boredom: this club becames the SOS Brigade, which has no clear purpose other than to do whatever Haruhi wants to do.\nThe plot gets interesting when the other three members turns out to be of supernatural origin (a time traveler, an alien robot made from ""information"" and a superpowered member of a secret society), who are all there to keep an eye on Haruhi, who is some sort of a God (can create, manipulate and destroy reality at her will), something that she\'s obviously not aware of, and it must be kept a secret from her (alongside the identities of the other members) because reasons.\nSo like that the anime switches between the Brigade having random adventures (making a movie, playing baseball, solving a murder) and Kyon (the focus character) being involved in some weird complots and subplots that involves time travel, alien bugs and some other shenanigans.\nThe anime itself is light-hearted and entertaining, but the movie itself is on another level.\n*tt1572781* deals, as the title suggests, with the title character suddenly disappearing and reality being modified. Kyon wakes up in December 18th and suddenly finds reality altered out of nowhere, without the usual culprit on sight, and he has to find out on his own what happened and how can he fix it.\nThe movie, unfortunately, requires that the viewer knows the background of the TV series and the characters, as the movie jumps straight into the setting without that much chance to catch up... but trust me when I said the experience is worthy.\nFor starters, the film is gorgeously animated and is a visual delight to watch, *Haruhi* the anime Was already a great looking anime but the movie easily tops it and put itself among the big leagues... another thing to notice is that the movie is the second longest animated movie ever with a whopping runtime of 162 minutes (credits included), one minute behind the 70mm version of *Haruhi Suzumiya*.\nThe movie runs it\'s gargantuan runtime with a slow, almost poetical pace more akin to that of an arthouse film, a far cry from the generally fast paced anime. The calculated animation, the intentionally  slow pacing and use of classic music (Erik Satie\'s Gymnopedie No. 1 plays a large role on the movie) also separates the movie from the more bombastic anime films you might be used to.\nAlthough some people might find the movie slow and boring, I personally loved it, and it\'s one of my favorite Christmas traditions to rewatch it every year.\nIf you wanna watch the anime and the movie, both are surprisingly easily available on YouTube and can be watched on several orders. I\'m not gonna get that much into that but if you wanna give the anime, and then the movie a try, DON\'T skip the infamous *Haruhi Suzumiya* saga (a series of episodes with a time loop) right away, as they are actually necessary to understand the climax of the movie... just watch the second and the right episode and you\'ll be fine.\nThe trailer: https://youtu.be/qpbySfGofVc']",1.0,1.0

I've been looking for a good show for way too long and just can't find one that I want to stick with. I'm just gonna force myself through whatever is the most upvoted and if I like it, great. \nI loved tt0101548 and recently started watching tt9256538 (love it, but also want a lighter show to watch--Somewhere between the two but closer to tt0101548 would probably be the limit for me right now.)\nThanks Reddit\nEdit: tt0287978 was good but a little slow paced for what I’m looking for now. How I Met Your Mother was great, hated the ending. tt8193366 was amazing. I watched tt6210996 and I guess that was pretty okay. tt0070468 was good, but I’d like something with less dry humor this time. That’s... about everything I’ve watched. ""]",1.0,1.0

Just finished watching this intense and powerful war thriller about a group of young German POWs who are forced to clear a beach of thousands of land mines under the watch of a Danish Sergeant who slowly learns to appreciate their plight. It’s one of the best foreign films I have ever seen.\nThe film manages to expertly balance nail-biting tension and hard-hitting drama. As the prisoners disarm the mines, you’re afraid a bomb could go off anytime and you’re constantly reminded that these people were just young boys.\nRoland Møller was outstanding in this as their terrifying, but increasingly empathetic commander and the prisoners were also played brilliantly by a handful of young German actors.\nThe writing is poignant and emotional, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. \nTo those who have not seen it, please go and see it as soon as you can.

But I just watched Scorsese\'s ""tt0407887"" for the first time and have to share my experience.\nFirst of all let me say that Scorsese is one of my favorite directors (and I still don\'t know why I never watched tt0407887) and tt0407887 is arguably my favorite movie of all time.\nWhile tt0407887 has many similarities with tt0407887 - the voice over, the ensemble cast of important characters, the mafia/mob thematic, and basic themes of greed and betrayal - it quickly evolves into something new. It is one of the most intense and suspenseful movies I have ever seen. Like literally, there is a scene where a phone rings, and it\'s the most intense scene ever.\nIt\'s so layered and complex that it even is hard to follow sometimes, who can play the cat/mouse (or should I say rat) game better? And then when it settles and moves at its own speed to follow the unconventional narrative and storytelling, it escalates into a few quick kills in the end. See, it doesn\'t grab someone emotionally and that\'s quite unique. The escalation is logical consequence from the sense of urgency created over the whole movie. It\'s brilliant captured in the final shot.\nOther than that, typical Scorsese - cast delivers (abso-fuckin-loutely), great soundtrack, great imagery and over all really memorable dialogue.\nWhat do you think about tt0407887?']",1.0,1.0

We really don\'t know if what we saw were ""true"" events or invented to improve her, since she appears to be an AI simulation.  \nThe movie intimates that the human race was destroyed but tt0294251\'s description of discovering some humans who were intellectually curious/advanced that caused him to re-think his plan to destroy Earth.  I couldn\'t tell if that meant he saved a few people and destroyed the rest or selected a few people to interact with the aliens who enhanced him and left the rest of us alone.  I think it\'s possible to conclude that most of what we saw was a simulated Turing Test to assess Mack\'s AI consciousness.  It seems possible this scenario was run over and over to improve her responses until she had developed sufficiently to meet the aliens who were in communication with tt0294251.  Perhaps part of their ""enhancements"" were instructions on preparing a few humans to travel to meet them.   \nOne of the recent trends in space exploration is the use of nonhuman explorers which would necessarily include AI entities who could survive the long periods necessary to travel the vast distances between stars.  It\'s possible Mack was being prepared for such a long trip.  \nOne other thought, Mack\'s situation at the end where she will explore with tt0294251 reminded me of Clarke\'s version oftt56404500 where Bowman requests a companion and is provided with HAL tt5640450.\n']",0.0,0.0

As someone who is trying to get inspired for writing a story exploring this concept, I'd like to dive deeper into this. A good idea for this type of thing, though different section, would be from the television show called tt8193366, where we follow the story through the eyes of Walter White and slowly see him turn from being the hero of his story to becoming the villain of his story. So while there will still probably need to be a hero (Or not, depending on the type of story), one thing that would separate the hero from the main protagonist is that we are following the story primarily through the eyes of the villain, rather than the hero, although we would often get glimpses of what the hero is up to, leading up to the final battle of the hero and the villain so we see that the villain would get stopped.

The setting, dialogue, cinematography are all top notch for an Indian film, and I know something about Indian films, as I am one myself(I am an indian, not a indian film) :p\nThe story is set in 1900's India and follows it upto it's independence in 1947, across three generations of Vinayak's family, the protagonist of the story. tt8239946 is basically a mythological story about a goddess who created the entire universe. The plot revolves around the consequences when humans build a temple for her first-born.\nI hope you guys watch this awesome movie, you won't regret it one bit.\nIMDB link of the movie :-  https://m.imdb.com/title/tt8239946/\nIt's available on amazon prime in India.\nEdit:- For prime users in the US, check this :- https://twitter.com/AmazonHelp/status/1068511119927586816?s=20\n""]",1.0,1.0

Now I‘m not saying that an alien invasion is plausible, but it all makes sense in context to the film.\nAll of this leads to gripping action scenes with great alien/monster creatures and a great pay-off.

If anyone has any suggestions I’d be very appreciative.\n\nI do have one TV show I’m going to write about, which is ‘End of the F***ing World’ where the protagonist’s mother committed suicide when he was a child and by the time the show begins he’s pretty mentally disturbed as he seeks out a relationship with a classmate. Trying not to do any more TV series (hence the subbredit) but something along those lines would be great! Also I’m not seeking movies where the parent dies during the timeframe the movie takes place, as I’m looking for more of the effects of it later in that character’s life.

Theatrically released in the UK on November 23rd, 1984 and then as a TV special in the US on December 17th of the same year, this is, in my opinion, the definitive adaption of the book. Directed by Clive Donner and filmed in the town of Shrewsbury, where Dickens first read aloud tt1067106, this version is brimming with beautiful scenery, compelling acting and beautiful costumes. Coupled with a powerful orchestral score complete with a reoccurring musical theme (""So grant us all a change of heart""), this version makes all others pale in comparison. George C. Scott really shines as tt1067106. Bringing countless years of acting expertise, Scott makes tt1067106 a character that, even at his worst, is a character you can still sympathize with and understand. Frank Finlay as Jacob Marley is a truly unforgettable experience. He plays the specter with such compassion that it will stick in your mind long after watching the movie. The scenes where Marley haunts tt1067106 really freaked me out as child.\nThis is the version I grew up with. This is the adaption I have watched for countless Christmases and find myself enjoying every time.

One of my favorite Christmas movies AND animated movies of all time is the 2010 Japanese film *tt1572781*, a continuation/conclusion to the anime *The Melancholy of tt1572781*, which in turn it\'s based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa. However, as much as I would like to do a straightforward recommendation I can\'t because the movie is impenetrable without the context of the TV series, which might seems like a detriment but considering even people who don\'t like the series actually love the movie, it\'s at least worth a shot.\n*tt1572781*, the anime, focuses on the title character, a smart/cute/athletic high school girl who doesn\'t like normal reality and would rather spend her time in crazy supernatural adventures with aliens, time travelers and espers (people with inhuman abilities). The other lead character is Kyon, a cynical and not-so-bright high schooler who somehow befriends Haruhi and eventually convince her to create her own club in order to cure her boredom: this club becames the SOS Brigade, which has no clear purpose other than to do whatever Haruhi wants to do.\nThe plot gets interesting when the other three members turns out to be of supernatural origin (a time traveler, an alien robot made from ""information"" and a superpowered member of a secret society), who are all there to keep an eye on Haruhi, who is some sort of a God (can create, manipulate and destroy reality at her will), something that she\'s obviously not aware of, and it must be kept a secret from her (alongside the identities of the other members) because reasons.\nSo like that the anime switches between the Brigade having random adventures (making a movie, playing baseball, solving a murder) and Kyon (the focus character) being involved in some weird complots and subplots that involves time travel, alien bugs and some other shenanigans.\nThe anime itself is light-hearted and entertaining, but the movie itself is on another level.\n*tt1572781* deals, as the title suggests, with the title character suddenly disappearing and reality being modified. Kyon wakes up in December 18th and suddenly finds reality altered out of nowhere, without the usual culprit on sight, and he has to find out on his own what happened and how can he fix it.\nThe movie, unfortunately, requires that the viewer knows the background of the TV series and the characters, as the movie jumps straight into the setting without that much chance to catch up... but trust me when I said the experience is worthy.\nFor starters, the film is gorgeously animated and is a visual delight to watch, *Haruhi* the anime Was already a great looking anime but the movie easily tops it and put itself among the big leagues... another thing to notice is that the movie is the second longest animated movie ever with a whopping runtime of 162 minutes (credits included), one minute behind the 70mm version of *Haruhi Suzumiya*.\nThe movie runs it\'s gargantuan runtime with a slow, almost poetical pace more akin to that of an arthouse film, a far cry from the generally fast paced anime. The calculated animation, the intentionally  slow pacing and use of classic music (Erik Satie\'s Gymnopedie No. 1 plays a large role on the movie) also separates the movie from the more bombastic anime films you might be used to.\nAlthough some people might find the movie slow and boring, I personally loved it, and it\'s one of my favorite Christmas traditions to rewatch it every year.\nIf you wanna watch the anime and the movie, both are surprisingly easily available on YouTube and can be watched on several orders. I\'m not gonna get that much into that but if you wanna give the anime, and then the movie a try, DON\'T skip the infamous *Haruhi Suzumiya* saga (a series of episodes with a time loop) right away, as they are actually necessary to understand the climax of the movie... just watch the second and the right episode and you\'ll be fine.\nThe trailer: https://youtu.be/qpbySfGofVc']",1.0,1.0

It\'s strange to fit tt0365748 (Edgar Wright, 2004) in a genre. Of course it\'s funny, so it\'s a comedy. But it also has lots of zombies and tension, so it\'s a horror movie. But it actually has some really engaging character interactions and character moments, so it\'s a drama.\nIt\'s all of it and it\'s fucking brilliant!\nEdgar Wright manages to mix the trivial and conventional with something so absurd and ridiculous and the result is nothing short of incredible.\nThe story is fairly conventional british drama in the first act, then it introduces the zombies and how our characters react to them and then it\'s a completely survival/massacre in the end.\nThe script is close to perfect. Every element or plot point or theme introduced in the beginning, somehow affects the later circumstances. Be it a catchphrase, a character relation, a place or even a video game instruction.\nThe performances are top notch, the humor works brilliantly, but even the characters feel so ""real"" and relatable.I could go on and on and talk about the one liners and all the ingenious moments but I\'m just gonna stop and ask you, what do you think about tt0365748?\n']",1.0,1.0

It\'s refreshing to watch a something that isn\'t afraid to tt22476178its time setting everything up. I loved how long it took for us to meet the villain. Then his intro was spectacular. I immediately knew what type of villain Hans was going to be. What a smooth entrance. Although I will say, Hans never really seemed German.  The other villains had very distinctly german inflections when they spoke, while Hans used a more general European accent. Nothing major, just if 11/13 members of your group speak with an inflection then you should as well. I assume part of thtt22476178ice was to distinguish Hans even further from the rest of his group.\nI loved tt22476178. He was cool and badass like tt0936501, while also feeling jagged and unrefined. It was clear that he was out of his element from the getgo, which made watching him feel so gosh darn compelling. His resourcefulness was great! I loved that he never felt special when it came to his physical or mental ability- he frankly just did what was necessary to survive. Shooting the fleeing cop car was an interesting and unexpected moment which set my expectations for the remainder of the film. tt0095016 isn\'t noteworthy in any category other than his tenacity. \nThe first physical meeting between Hans and John was definitely a highlight. Watching the two of them feel each other out was incredible. The moment where Hans confirms it\'s indeed tt0095016 was phenomenal. Rickman made an absolutely perfect face for the occasion.\nOverall, it was a fantastic film.\n**8/10**\n**tt0095016 Trilogy**\nI watched all three of these films back to back, so I currently view them as an inseperable unit. They were enjoyable but their in-universe logic was frustratingly inconsistent. Throughout all three films, Doc is initially hesitant to change the past as any alteration could potentially destroy the future. He then proceeds to condone alterations so long as they improve the lives of either himself or tt0095016\'s family. When an external person, a la Biff Tannen, attempted to do essentially the same thing Doc became very preachy about time travel safety. I understand Biff is selfish and antagonistic, but still the hypocrasy was degraded his character to me. \n It was frustrating that every tt0936501 man seemed to act exactly like George tt0054215 from prior to John McClane\'s interference. Realistically, I\'m sure that not every member of the John McClane lineage could be that cartoonishly submissive. The third film\'s character, Sheamus John McClane, certainly felt more pacifistic than submissive. Where did that trait spawn then? How did tt2911666 Jr become submissive when his father was clearly aggressive. \nMost of the trilogy felt like this many scenes created more questions than they did coherency.\nJohn McClane\'s ""story arc"" was John McClaneg for me as well. I\'d prefer if it centered around a more interesting topic than John McClane getting aggressive whenever his masculinity was called into question. \nThat\'s all for today! Hopefully, later entries will be a bit better written. I\'m using this as practice as I recover. John McClane. It was possibly a bad idea to write this immediately after getting surgery.\n']",1.0,1.0

Tonight I had the pleasure seeing [tt2837574](https://imdb.com/title/tt2837574/).  The writing and performances were just grand.  Sissy Spacek and Robert Redford have such great chemistry when they’re together on screen. The love story being told between them made me smile so much. And it wasn’t hitting you over the head, it just felt natural. And the two of them of such powerhouses.  I know Sissy has received her fair share of acclaim over her career (including an Oscar win and 5 other nominations) but she still feels like such an underrated actress.  \nI hadn’t looked at the cast list prior to seeing the movie so I was pleasantly surprised at some of the actors who showed up in some of the second and minor roles including Danny Glover, Tom Waits, Tula Sumpter, and a brief appearance from Elisabeth Moss. \nThe only complaint I had was ultimately a minor one. There was a directorial choice that was repeated in a couple scenes where he would, in the middle of a conversation between Robert and Sissy, slow pan away from the two of them to something mundane.   I remember it happening twice, once while the two are in a diner, and again later as they sat on the porch of ranch house.   It was the sort of thing in the moment where you’re expecting it be relevant or show you something important happening during what is otherwise just a normal conversation.  The best I could figure is there are 2 important event later in the film that seem to lead out of shots similar to the final moment of the slow pan in each location but I wasn’t sure. \nI’d bet the movie gets mostly overlooked come awards season because it is so very understated and casual (in the best way possible) but I could see the nominating voters throwing a legacy bone to Redford (who would absolutely deserve it for his performance)  since he’s announced it’s going to be his last film. But I would be thrilled to see Sissy get a supporting nomination (though the actress categories are shaping up to be tt1753865 style bloodbaths this year).\nBut yeah, like I said, it was just delightful and sweet, and even though I ultimately felt it was a sad story (but that was likely based on my personal reactions to certain story elements, and wouldn’t be most people’s) I smiled and laughed almost non-stop and would recommend seeing it to anyone who just wants to have a nice evening to relax, feel good, and see some true legends in their career twilight have fun on screen together.']",1.0,1.0

Back then, if you just happened to catch a film on TV and didn't have a guide or know what it was, you had almost no way of finding out what you were watching. You were also at the mercy of the selection at places like Blockbuster, Suncoast, Best Buy, etc. to find films to watch and they usually carried the big Hollywood films and a handful of lesser-known titles but many places didn't even have a foreign film section, let alone foreign animated films.\nEven though I first saw this film on a grainy-channel with no idea what I was watching, I was still fascinated by everything about it and it wasn't until years later that I was finally able to see a high-quality version and learned that this film has been a huge inspiration to sci-fi films and television for the last 40+ years.\nThere's now a Blu Ray release and I think even a Criterion edition so if you haven't seen this film yet and like sci-fi movies like tt0133152, tt0120197/Trek, tt0083658, tt1160419, etc, then you won't regret watching this movie.\nAs a follow-up film, I recommend [Gandahar (1988)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095525).

As a huge fan of pitch black comedy, I expected to love them but found both to be much too dry and bleak even for me. The monotone dialogue also didn't help.\nIt was with some trepidation, then, that I approached this movie. It is incredible. I cannot recommend it enough. \nThe biggest highlight for me was seeing the three lead actors, Stone, Weisz and Colman, at the absolute top of their games. Every comment and look is laden with subtext and the three of them have such an amazing performance chemistry, I was in awe. Particularly with Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne with such conviction. It may sound silly but I genuinely got emotional about halfway through, not at what was happening on screen but instead through sheer admiration and appreciation for her astounding performance.\nI feel that it is being overlooked that this is the first of his movies that isn't actually written by him and I think his direction compliments the dark and surreal script perfectly. I laughed out loud at this movie more than I have at a picture in quite a while. \nThe other thing I really loved about this movie is that NONE of the characters are black and white. Almost every main player in the narrative is grey, with moments that will make you love them and hate them in equal measure. It's such an interesting experience as an audience member wrestling with your feelings towards almost every character.\nAnyway, I just wanted to air my thoughts here as I don't have anywhere else to. I recommend it to anybody who may be on the fence due to his previous work (which I know is also well loved!)""]",1.0,1.0

I'd be actually very happy for an isolationist america.   \nNow why is is a Racially tense time? Media fear mongering against the police shootings of ethnic minorities could be the reason. The current political extremism of both the left and right separating people into two groups, pretty much promoting tribalism. And a president people feel don't represents them. I could keep going on.  \nOh how about maybe the fact that the lower class and poverty line Americans starting to question the system of trickle down economy.
